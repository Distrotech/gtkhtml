Version 0.9, "Lighthouse", 2000-12-14
-------------------------------------

General:

 - Fixed X selections so that we no longer try to pass UTF-8 encoded text
   in STRING atoms.

 - Improved the table layout code so that now we render tables very close
   to the big name browsers, one or two small issues left

 - Added many missing attributes to the HTML export code so that at least
   we pass on the attributes we understand.

 - Support for sub sup and strike elements.

 - We now parse param elements before emitting the object requested signal
   so that we can make an informed choice about whether or not the object is
   supported.

Editor:

 - We now hook to the gnome-spell component to do spelling.

 - Rename the idl and oafinfo to bring us in line with the new naming
   conventions

 - The editor control now exposes an interface for issuing editor commands

Ebrowser:
 
 - New component to support simple browsing tasks.
