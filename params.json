{"name":"Gtkhtml","tagline":"Mirror of git://git.gnome.org/gtkhtml","body":"Licensing\r\n---------\r\n\r\n        The library is released under the LGPL\r\n\r\nWhat is GtkHTML?\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nGtkHTML is a lightweight HTML rendering/printing/editing engine.  It\r\nwas originally based on KHTMLW, part of the KDE project, but is now\r\nbeing developed independently.\r\n\r\nMailing list\r\n------------\r\n\r\nGtkHTML is currently maintained by the Evolution team and no longer\r\nhas its own mailing list.  The best place to ask GtkHTML questions\r\nis on the \"evolution-hackers\" mailing list.\r\n\r\nYou can subscribe to this list at:\r\n\r\n        http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/evolution-hackers\r\n\r\nYou can also report GtkHTML bugs by filing a report at:\r\n\r\n        http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=GtkHtml\r\n\r\nNOTICE: While GtkHTML is still being maintained, it is no longer being\r\n        actively developed and is not recommended for new applications.\r\n        Consider WebKit/GTK+ or Gecko instead.\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\n\r\nIn order to compile GtkHTML, you need:\r\n       gail >= 1.1\r\n       GTK+ >= 2.16\r\n       enchant\r\n       iso-codes >= 0.49\r\n       gnome-icon-theme >= 2.22\r\n\r\nIf you want to try the test program `testgtkhtml', you also need\r\nlibsoup-2.4 or later.\r\n\r\nTo try it out, run testgtkhtml in the source directory, i.e:\r\n\r\n    cd gtkhtml\r\n    ./testgtkhtml\r\n\r\nWARNING: testgtkhtml's URL fetching code is very buggy.\r\n\r\nYou can also test GtkHTML's simple HTML editor widget:\r\n\r\n    cd components/editor\r\n    ./gtkhtml-editor-test\r\n\r\nThe editor widget is used in Evolution's mail composer.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
